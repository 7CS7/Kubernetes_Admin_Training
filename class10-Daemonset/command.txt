kubectl get all

see now daemonset is 3 running in each client node.because daemonset is mandatory for each worker or client node.

i have only 4 machine including server.so i am doing this test in node3.

kubeadm reset (in node3 give it)

in master run kubectl get all

now you see only daemonset will 2.

kubectl exec -ti pod/nginx-6jlrm bash (loging into one of the pod)



once i configured automatically if i add any linux machine then in that linux machine this ngnix also will be deployed

kubectl get daemonsets
kubectl descibe daemonsets
