services

https://github.com/FourTimes/Kubernetes/blob/master/service/loadbalancer-facebook.yaml
https://github.com/FourTimes/Kubernetes/blob/master/service/loadbalancer-twiiter.yaml

the above loadbalancer yaml will work only if you have the nodes in google cloud.because you will have the public ip.

https://github.com/FourTimes/Kubernetes/blob/master/service/nodeport-twitter.yaml

kubectl get pod,services -n twitter -o wide

35.227.119.203:32001

access like above from all node machine ip addresses.it should work from all client machine ip address.then the proxy cluster is working good.

kubectl get services
kubectl describe services
